## how to install and run your program:

1. Clone the repository containing your program by running the command "git clone <repository url>" in your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned using "cd <repository folder>".
3. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already done so by downloading it from their website or using your package manager.
4. Build the Docker image for your program using the command "docker build -t <image name> .". Make sure to replace <image name> with a suitable name for your image.
5. Run the container using the command "docker run <image name>". This will start the container and run your program. You should see the output of your program in the terminal.
6. If you want to modify and test your program, you can edit the source code on your local machine and rebuild the image using step 4.

That's it! You should now be able to install and run your program on Docker.
